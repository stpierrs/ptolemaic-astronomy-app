// Canonical (lat, lon) → disc position. Default is hard-coded
// north-pole azimuthal-equidistant; the FE grid, observer placement,
// and every above-disc anchor share this single coordinate framework.
//
// Lat / lon is just an observation label — same coordinates pilots and
// sailors put into their GPS and their charts. We translate to disc xy
// here and use it everywhere the dome anchors, sun GP, eclipse path,
// etc. need a position. Right?
//
// Where the graticule actually comes from. Ptolemy's *Almagest*
// preface lays out the two-sphere conceptual model: a terrestrial
// sphere carrying lat / lon, and a celestial sphere carrying RA / Dec.
// Both spheres are coordinate constructs — abstractions for organising
// observation. The celestial sphere is built by amalgamating
// alt / az measurements from observers all over the earth into one
// stitched-together picture of the dome; the terrestrial sphere is
// the same coordinate trick applied to the observer side. Right?
//
// The pairing is the key: every point on the celestial sphere
// uniquely corresponds to a point on the terrestrial sphere at a
// given UTC — that's the right-ascension ↔ longitude / declination ↔
// latitude relationship. We use it everywhere the sun's GP, moon's
// GP, or any tracked body's GP gets painted on the disc. The two
// "spheres" are just the same observation indexed two ways; the
// graticule we lay out below is a flat representation of the
// terrestrial half of that pair, and the projections in the
// `projections.js` registry are just choices of how to flatten it.
// Read the *Almagest* preface — that's where the framework starts.
//
// Projections that opt into `useProjectionGrid` can override the
// framework via `setActiveProjection(id)`. Currently:
//   • `dp` — dual-pole AE world model (forced when WorldModel = 'dp')
//   • `proportional` (= 'Proportional AE Map') and `hellerick` —
//     both back onto the Hellerick boreal triaxial graticule
// While such an override is active, every caller that goes through
// `canonicalLatLongToDisc` lands on the override projection's disc —
// observer, sun / moon GPs, optical-vault rays, eclipse paths, etc. —
// so the visualisation stays internally consistent end-to-end.
//
// Projections without `useProjectionGrid` (mercator / equirect / etc.)
// are treated as decorative art only and don't override the framework.
